	<h2> Twenty One Pilots (2009)</h2>
		

		<p>Twenty One Pilots is the self-titled debut studio album by American band Twenty One Pilots, released independently on December 29, 2009. The album sold 115,000 copies and peaked at number 139 on the U.S. Billboard 200. It is the only album to feature bassist Nick Thomas and drummer Chris Salih before they both left the band in 2011.</p>

		<p>Sometime after the release of the record, it was revealed that the album was conceptualized and recorded within the homemade recording studio in the basement of the house that Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas, Chris Salih, and Thomas's brother were staying in at the time. Additionally, while input was provided from the other members of the band, the lyrics were mainly written by Joseph.</p>

		<p>The album cover was designed by John Rettstatt, a friend of Joseph.</p>

	<h2> Regional at Best  (2011)</h2>

		<p>Regional at Best is the second studio album by American music duo Twenty One Pilots. It was self-released on July 8, 2011. Regional at Best is a discontinued album. It is the last album released by the band prior to signing a record deal with Fueled by Ramen, and it is the first album to feature the talents of Josh Dun who joined the band in 2011 after the departure of bassist Nick Thomas and drummer Chris Salih. The album features many tracks that also appear on Vessel, with some of them being rerecorded for the later album. As part of the band's deal with Fueled by Ramen to release Vessel, the album was discontinued, with no physical or digital copies available for sale. Only six tracks on Regional at Best do not feature on any other album and are considered out of print. Some of the album's tracks are available through the music streaming service Pandora. The full album is only available on Deezer. </p>

	<h2> Vessel (2013)</h2>
		

		<p>Vessel is the third studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, which was released on January 8, 2013. It is the band's first album released via Fueled by Ramen, and is their major-label debut album. As of July 2016, the album has sold over 569,000 copies. All of its tracks have been certified at least Gold by the RIAA, making Twenty One Pilots the first group or artist to achieve this feat with the two separate albums.</p>

		<p> High-school colleagues Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas, and Chris Salih formed Twenty One Pilots in 2009. The group released their debut album Twenty One Pilots. Both Thomas and Salih parted ways with the band in 2011. Soon afterwards, Josh Dun joined the band; Joseph had been friends with Dun for around a year. Joseph first saw Dun when he was playing a show with House of Heroes. Joseph said that he "loved" the performance. The band released Regional at Best later that year. In June, the duo played their first out-of-state show to a group of 12 people. The pair soon gained popularity through a series of videos made by friend Mark C. Eshleman. The band played their last show as an unsigned band at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, Ohio, to a crowd of 1,800 in attendance. The duo signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2012.</p>

		<p>Blurryface is the fourth studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, released on May 17, 2015, through Fueled by Ramen.</p>

		<p>Like their previous album Vessel (2013), the album takes influence from various genres, including hip hop, rock, pop, reggae, and indie.

It contains the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride", which both reached the top-five on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

		<p>Blurryface was well-received by critics, who complimented its themes and musical diversity. It is considered to be the band's breakthrough album, becoming their first to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album has sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States as of April 2017. In 2018, Blurryface became the first album in the digital era to have every track receive at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. On May 15, 2019, it reached the milestone of being on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart for four years, never leaving the chart.</p>

It is the band's first studio album in three years, after the breakthrough success of their previous album, Blurryface (2015).
